  /*
   * - The PHY supports swapping of DRAM oscillator count values between paired DBytes for the
   *   purpose of tDQSDQ DRAM Drift Compensation(DDC).
   * - Each DByte has a register bit to control the source of the oscillator count value used
   *   to perform tDQSDQ Drift compensation.
   *   On silicon the training firmware will determine the DByte swap and program
   *   PptCtlStatic register to select oscillator count source. When skip_train is used,
   *   training firmware is skipped thus manual programming may be required depending on
   *   configuration.
   * - The default hardware configuration is for odd Dbyte instance n to use oscillator count
   *   values from its paired Dbyte instance n-1. So Dbyte1 will use the oscillator count
   *   values from Dbyte0, Dbyte3 will use Dbyte2 and so on. This is required for DRAM Data
   *   width =16.
   * - Each bit of this field corresponds to a DBYTE:
   *   - bit-0 = setting for DBYTE0
   *   - bit-1 = setting for DBYTE1
   *   - bit-2 = setting for DBYTE2
   *   - . . .
   *   - bit-n = setting for DBYTEn
   * - By setting the associated bit for each DByte to 1, PHY will use non-default source for
   *   count value.
   *   - for even Dbytes, non-default source is to use the odd pair count value.
   *   - for odd Dbytes, no-default source to use data received directly from the DRAM.
   * - Byte swapping must be the same across different ranks.
   * - must be set as hex
   * - default : 0x0
   * - if Byte mode devices are indicated via the x8mode messageBlock parameter, this variable
   *   is ignored as PHY only supports a limited configuration set based on Byte mode
   *   configuration.
   *
   * Example:
   *   DramByteSwap = 0x03 - Dbyte0: use count values from Dbyte1, Dbyte1 uses count values
   *   received directly received from DRAM.
   *   Rest of Dbytes have default source for DRAM oscilator count.
