# Purpose

The BSP (Board Specific Package) drivers are parts of the STM32Cube package based on the HAL drivers and provide a set of high level APIs relative to the hardware components and features in the Disco boards coming with the STM32Cube package for a given STM32 series.

The BSP drivers allow a quick access to the boards’ services using high level APIs and without any specific configuration as the link with the HAL and the external components is done in intrinsic within the drivers.

From project settings points of view, user has only to add the necessary driver’s files in the workspace and call the needed functions from examples. However some low level configuration functions are weak and can be overridden by the applications if user wants to change some BSP drivers default behavior.
